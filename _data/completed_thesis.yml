  Bio: "I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the School of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Leeds. I am a member of the Motor Control and Neurorehabilitation and Neural Circuits research themes. I do research in Computational Neuroscience with a special focus on Motor Control, Decision Making, Multi-sensory Integration & Sensory-Motor Coupling. I develop and implement computational methods from Machine Learning (Dimensionality Reduction, Classification, Regression etc) and Information Theory to analyse and model high-dimensional neural, biomedical and behavioural signals. I couple large-scale computational modelling with behavioral experiments and advanced neuroimaging and neurophysiology techniques (EEG-EMG) to understand the neural and behavioural mechanisms underlying sensory-motor behaviours in healthy humans and clinical populations.<br>I teach courses in Motor Control, Neuroscience and Quantitative methods in the Sport and Exercise Sciences programme and the Neuroscience programme.<br>I received a Diploma from the University of Patras, Greece (2006) and a M.Sc. from the University of Minnesota, USA (2009) both in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience from the University of Genoa, Italy (2013). I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology, University of Glasgow (Jan 2013- Dec 2015) and the Biomedical Engineering Department, Columbia University (Jan 2016- Dec 2017). I have been a Lecturer in Motor Control at the University of Leeds since January 2018"
