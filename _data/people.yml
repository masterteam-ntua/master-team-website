During his doctoral studies, he investigated the role of Hippo and Wnt key signaling pathways in tumorigenesis and stem cell biology. Between 2014-2015, Dr Papaspyropoulos worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, having received an MRC DTP Postdoctoral Fellowship Award. In the cancer field, Dr Papaspyropoulos became involved with the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of tumor suppressive genes and their role in cancer stem cell biology. In the stem cell field, his research in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and embryonic stem cells contributed to the elucidation of key mechanisms governing the transition from pluripotency to differentiation during embryogenesis. Between 2015-2018, Dr Papaspyropoulos moved to the Netherlands where he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Hubrecht Institute for Developmental Biology and Stem Cell Research, Utrecht University. His research was focused on the establishment and implementation of organoids as a personalized medicine platform against human disease, particularly lung and colorectal cancer. Between 2019-2023, Dr Papaspyropoulos worked as a senior postdoctoral fellow (recipient of an IKY fellowship) at the Department of Biochemistry, School of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (2019-2020), and later (2020-2023) at the Department of Histology-Embryology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School. Dr Papaspyropoulos is currently (2024-) Assistant Professor of Histology-Embryology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School. His research activity involves the elucidation of signaling pathways and (epi)genetic events governing tumorigenesis, aging and stem cell biology as well as the development and use of organoids in precision oncology.'
