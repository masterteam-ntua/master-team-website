  Bio: "Christopher Provatidis has a Diploma Degree in Mechanical-Electrical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens 1979 and a PhD also in Mechanical Engineering from the NTUA, 1987. The author's major field of study is applied mechanics, and particularly in the modeling and design of metallic and composite material structures. He served the Greek Army (Technical Branch 1980-1981) and then worked in projects concerning mechanical equipment of large buildings and particularly hospitals (1981-1982). In 1982, he moved to the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) to work at the 'Machine Elements & Dynamics Laboratory'. He was appointed as Lecturer (1989-1993), Assistant Professor (1994-2002), Associate Professor (2002-2009) and he is currently Full Professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering at NTUA, Greece. In the same school, he served as a Vice-Chairman (2005-2007). He has participated in about 40 European and national research projects. He has supervised over 160 diploma-works or MSc theses and nine completed PhD theses. He has written four books and three monographs in Greek and one Springer monograph in English. Over the past 40 years, he has worked across a wide discipline to include components of several sectors in mechanical simulation (elastostatics, crack and fatigue analysis, elastodynamics, acoustics, structural optimization, light-weight structures, textile micromechanics, thermal analysis, biomechanics: orthodontics, dental implants, orthopedics, inverse problems, system identification, gearless differentials, dynamics, CAD/CAE integration, etc) in conjunction with the finite element method, the boundary element method and other computational methods. As a result, he has more than 400 publications in refereed journals and conference proceedings. Current research interests include computational biomechanics as well as 3D-printing. He is a member of ASME, AIAA, European Society of Biomechanics (ESB), Greek Society of Biomechanics (Vice-president, 2008-2010), and Greek Association of Computational Mechanics (General Secretary, 2007-2009). In March 2011 he was elected as an active member (Class VI: Technical and Environmental Sciences) of the European Academy."
