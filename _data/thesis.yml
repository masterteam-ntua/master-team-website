- Title: 'In silico generation of 4D flow MRI data employing computational fluid dynamics simulations in patient-specific abdominal aortic aneurysm models'
  Text: 'There are only limited medical imaging methodologies to non-invasively and accurately assess the blood flow and its properties. The most advanced technique is 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), that enables the calculation of hemodynamic fields across extended vascular regions and can be further processed to produce clinically relevant hemodynamic indices, such as wall shear stresses. The aim of the thesis is to in silico generate 4D flow MRI-like training data starting from computational hemodynamic simulations in patient-specific pathological vascular anatomies, particularly in abdominal aortic aneurysms. Several transformations will be implemented to bridge the gap between the computational fluid dynamics (CFD)- generated blood velocity field and actual imaging data derived from 4D Flow MRI scans. The candidate will collaborate with vascular surgeons and radiologists from the “Attikon” University Hospital who will provide real 4D MRI scans for validation purposes.'

  Text: 'Hemodynamics, the study of blood flow in the circulatory system, is vital for understanding various physiological and pathological processes in the human body. Current non-invasive, high-resolution methods like computational fluid dynamics (CFD) face limitations, particularly in clinical applicability due to high resource demands. This study aims to introduce physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a novel approach for quantifying key hemodynamic parameters, specifically in vascular diseases like arterial stenoses and aneurysms. Training data will be generated using CFD to simulate pulsatile hemodynamics in simplified vascular anatomies, incorporating the injection and transport of contrast agents commonly used in medical imaging tests like computed tomography angiographies. Through PINNs, velocity and pressure fields, along with clinically important hemodynamic indices, can be inversely deduced from the contrast agent transport. The accuracy and generalizability of the PINNs methodology will be rigorously tested against CFD and its applicability for patient-specific 3D hemodynamic modeling.'

- Title: 'Pumping effect of an Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump. A numerical non-linear model'
  Text: "The Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) is a reciprocating pump that operates in series with the heart. Currently, it is one of the most widespread and extensively used methods for temporarily providing mechanical support to the circulatory system, functioning on the principle of counterpulsation. This principle is based on the reduction of aortic pressure during left ventricular systole and an increase in aortic pressure during left ventricular dilation. These primary changes subsequently lead to an increase in coronary flow and oxygen supply to the myocardium, as well as a reduction in the heart's oxygen requirements and a decrease in the systolic workload of the left ventricle. IABP support involves placing a balloon on a catheter in the descending thoracic aorta and coordinating the expansion and contraction of the balloon with the cardiac cycle. In the proposed project, a net flow rate in the aorta will be simulated using an IABP positioned within the aorta vessel, which includes the aortic valve. The cross-sectional area of the aortic valve varies over time as needed. By applying continuity and momentum fluid equations, a first-order differential equation with respect to flow rate is derived, incorporating a nonlinear term responsible for net flow rate generation. This differential equation will be solved numerically using a fourth-order Runge-Kuta numerical scheme."

- Title: 'Flow Rate Augmentation of Valveless Pumping Device via a Time-Dependent Stenosis: a numerical approach'
  Text: 'A valveless pump device consists of a closed hydraulic loop, including a flexible tube and a stiff tube with different elasticities. To achieve the pumping effect, three basic elements are essential: first, the tubes should have different elasticity; second, the excitation should be applied impulsively with relatively rapid acceleration and deceleration phases; and third, the compression point must not be midway along the more flexible tube (asymmetric excitation). Additionally, the installation of a time-dependent tube stenosis close to the pump’s pinching excitation can significantly increase the pumping effect. Flow rate augmentation results from the proper synchronization of the stenosis opening with the tube compression by the pincher. One potential application of this device could be as a blood flow booster in areas of the human body where the blood flow rate is abnormally low due to pathological reasons (ischemic episodes). The fact that this device does not require any external energy source is of paramount importance in this type of application. A device for flow rate augmentation will be simulated in a horizontal valveless closed loop pump using a time-dependent stenosis (convergent-divergent channel). The stenosis, integrated into the flexible tube of the pump, will be simulated as a local constriction attached to a compression spring with adjustable pretension, compressing the tube against a flat plate. Positioned on either side of the pump pincher, the shape of the stenosis changes over time, without any external power source, in response to the fluid pressure and the pretension of the spring. The spring pretension is a free parameter aimed at maximizing the net flow rate for each pinching frequency. Various pinching frequencies and compression ratios will be examined. Key parameters for flow enhancement will be evaluated, including the stenosis location along the loop, its opening, the compression ratio at the pincher area, and the pinching frequency.'

- Title: 'Computational modelling of endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms'
  Text: 'Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is preferred over open surgery for aortic aneurysms due to its minimally invasive nature, leading to lower in-hospital mortality rates. However, the long-term benefits of EVAR diminish after three years due to higher complication rates. Clinicians often rely on personal experience for stent-graft (SG) selection and procedural decisions, impacting long-term outcomes. This thesis will explore the use of computational modeling to predict SG deployment and tissue remodeling post-EVAR, aiming to improve preoperative planning and SG design. The methodology involves developing and validating computational models that simulate SG deployment and interaction with aortic tissue using patient-specific preoperative scans to generate accurate vessel models. Various deployment simulation methods, including virtual catheter, virtual shell, and direct placement methods, will be assessed for their efficiency and accuracy. The models will be validated by comparing simulation results with postoperative scans to ensure precision.'

  Text: 'This thesis will investigate the challenges and advancements in reconstructing patient-specific computational models of the vasculature, emphasizing the importance of accurately estimating the unpressurized zero stress state. Current models typically derive from medical images captured at various points in the cardiac cycle, resulting in geometries that reflect a pressurized state without clear intraluminal pressure parameters. This ambiguity in pressure conditions can significantly affect the accuracy of stress estimations on vascular walls. The research will explore the application of inverse elastostatic methods, originally developed for homogeneous elastic materials and later refined for complex, nearly incompressible materials, to address these challenges. By analyzing and refining the finite element formulations used in these methods, the study aims to improve the precision of reconstructed geometries under physiological or pathological pressures. Additionally, the thesis will consider the anisotropic properties of arterial walls and the presence of intraluminal thrombus (ILT) to enhance the predictive capabilities of these models. By integrating these factors, the research aspires to provide a more reliable framework for vascular modeling, potentially improving the prediction of the vascular stress state.'

- Title: 'Identifying unique morphological variations between abdominal aortic aneurysms of male and female patients via statistical shape modelling'
  Text: 'Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterized by the dilation and outward swelling of the abdominal aorta's wall. This condition predominantly affects older males (two to four times more frequently than females), but it is more severe in women. Consequently, the repair threshold for AAA is set at a maximum diameter of 5.5 cm in men and 5.0 cm in women. However, clinical guidelines acknowledge that “the size threshold for AAA repair in women and specific ethnic groups is an area of uncertainty requiring further research and high-quality long-term follow up cohort data may be the basis for better substantiated future recommendations.” The thesis aims to quantify morphological variations between AAAs in men and women. Using medical imaging data, the 3D reconstruction of AAA anatomy will be performed on an equal number of male and female patients using open software. Statistical shape modeling (SSM) will be employed to quantify morphological variations within the population. Principal component analysis (PCA) will identify linearly independent components that describe shape variation, capturing potential interactions between different morphological characteristics. The SSM will identify unique shape components, allowing for the reconstruction of an individual patient's AAA morphology from these components. These shape components may not correspond directly to known AAA morphological characteristics, as a component could represent a combination of these traits.'

This approach integrates both hemodynamics and the mechanical properties of the aortic wall, and can also incorporate the intraluminal thrombus (ILT) typically present in AAAs. Understanding these complex interactions is crucial for predicting potential rupture, which is a life-threatening complication.<br>This thesis aims to leverage SimVascular, an open-source software for cardiovascular simulations, to develop advanced FSI models of AAAs. By utilizing SimVascular's capabilities, the research will simulate the coupled dynamics of blood flow and arterial wall deformation under physiological and pathological (hypertension) conditions. These simulations will include detailed geometrical reconstructions of patient-specific AAAs obtained from medical imaging data, ensuring that the models accurately reflect the patient anatomy. The proposed research will involve several key steps. Initially, the geometries of AAAs will be reconstructed from imaging data, followed by mesh generation suitable for FSI simulations. Next, material properties of the aortic wall and ILT will be defined based on experimental data from the literature. The blood flow will be modeled using Navier-Stokes equations, while the structural response of the aortic wall and ILT will be captured using appropriate constitutive models. The thesis will explore various scenarios, including different blood pressure conditions and wall material properties, to understand their impact on the mechanical stresses and strains within the aneurysm. This will help identify critical factors that contribute to rupture risk.'

  Text: 'The purpose of this study is to develop a mathematical model that simulates blood flow in stenotic human vessels with elastic properties. The hemodynamic study includes the analysis of pressure and flow waveforms, which are key quantities characterizing the propagation of pulse waves in vessels. Pressure and flow waveforms continuously change as blood flows from the heart to peripheral vessels. In a specific cross-section of a vessel, the properties of the cardiovascular system (geometry, wall elasticity, peripheral resistance, heart rate, inertial forces, etc.) dictate the graph of these waveforms. Changes in these properties cause changes in pressure and flow waveforms.<br>Pressure and flow wave propagation in the human arterial system will be modeled using a one-dimensional, nonlinear analysis in a vessel. This one-dimensional consideration assumes that the pressure and flow in the three-dimensional space of the vessel can be represented by an appropriate calculated "average value" in each cross-section. The blood continuity and momentum equations, together with a nonlinear elastic membrane equation describing the vessel wall, constitute a nonlinear hyperbolic system of partial differential equations that is solved computationally using appropriate numerical discretization methods. Additionally, appropriate boundary conditions allow the model to be applied to any type of vessel. Two models will be constructed, differing in the equation that describes the movement of the vessel wall. The first model uses shell theory to describe the axial and radial displacement of the wall as a function of pressure and inertial forces. The second, more simplified model is based on the theory of elasticity, where the vessel wall is considered a membrane that experiences only tensile or compressive stresses tangential to its plane.<br>Many cardiovascular diseases are related to blood flow conditions in vessels. Arterial stenosis is one of the most serious cardiovascular diseases. For this reason, blood flow in a vessel with stenosis will be modeled to describe the changes in pressure and flow waveforms in relation to the initial physiological state.'

  Text: 'During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, many countries around the world experienced ventilator shortages due to the need to admit too many patients to Intensive Care Units (ICUs) simultaneously to treat Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), one of the serious complications of the coronavirus.<br>Two suitable pipe bifurcation and convergence devices for the inhalation and exhalation of two patients can be adapted to the outlet and inlet of a mechanical ventilator to support two patients simultaneously. By using these devices, mechanical ventilation can be provided for a long time to two patients from a single mechanical ventilator with an appropriate 'patient pairing.' With proper management, more patients in need can benefit. One condition that must be met when using ventilators with such connected flow dividers is that the pressure driving the airflow must be distributed equally and remain unchanged for each branch of a patient. However, this condition cannot be maintained when the connected patients have different somatometric characteristics and, importantly, different behavior in the resistance to airflow to and from the lungs during mechanical ventilation, such as varying degrees of lung fibrosis. If the resistance and compliance of the patients' lungs differ, there will be a spatially asymmetric pressure variation. This will result in asymmetric air drainage in each branch (Coandă effect), restricting airflow to one patient relative to the other and preventing free access of air to one branch of the flow divider.<br>Two geometric pipe structures will be designed, one bifurcated and one convergent, from which the intraluminal space of each will be extracted. This space will be meshed and segmented appropriately to represent the computational sections of the inspiratory and expiratory airflow, respectively. Appropriate software will be used to build the grid. The fluid dynamics will be simulated using suitable software, applying the equations of conservation of momentum (Navier-Stokes) and conservation of mass in a unified system of units (e.g., SI). The solution algorithm to solve the equations, the numerical scheme with its order of accuracy, the solution time step Δt, and the method for entering the boundary conditions into the software will be chosen accordingly. The velocity and pressure fields will be solved in the intraluminal space when two different patients, A and B, are connected to the ventilator. Patient A will have severe lung damage, and Patient B will have less lung damage. Based on the literature, they will have different resistance (RA ≠ RB) and different compliance (CA ≠ CB). The model will determine the different volumes of air each patient inhales and investigate whether the volumes of exhaled air match those that must be removed by each patient.'

After introducing a deformation law for the segment, an ordinary differential equation is derived. A vascular network is described by a system of these differential equations, along with a system of algebraic equations derived from the law of mass conservation applied to the network's nodes. A large-scale network would result in an unsolvable system due to the enormous number of equations; therefore, the method will be applied to large symmetrical and small nonsymmetrical networks of the interventricular septum.

The 209 image sections, each with a slice thickness of 0.5 mm, will be reconstructed using appropriate software (Materialise Mimics or 3D Slicer), along with several post-processing steps for surface refinement, to reveal the morphology of the flexible tube lumen when compressed by the pump’s rollers. This will enable the creation of geometric surface models representing the lumen fluid volume. Additionally, the exact deformation of the flexible tube around the squeezed area by the roller will be assessed to precisely determine the lumen volume, ensuring the accuracy of fluid injection.'

- Title: 'Assessing the effects of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on cerebral oxygenation using a one-dimensional blood flow simulator'
  Text: 'Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is a mechanical system that provides rapid, short-term support for patients experiencing cardiac failure. Many of these patients also have impaired pulmonary function, leading to poorly oxygenated cardiac output competing with well-oxygenated VA-ECMO output, a condition known as North-South syndrome. This syndrome is a significant concern due to its potential to cause cerebral hypoxia, which can lead to neurological complications commonly seen in these patients. To mitigate ischemic neurological complications, it is crucial to understand how clinical decisions regarding VA-ECMO parameters affect blood oxygenation. This project aims to study the impacts of flow rate and cannulation site on oxygenation using a one-dimensional (1D) model to simulate blood flow. The model will initially be validated by comparing its blood flow results to experimental data from VA-ECMO patients. The 1D model will then be integrated with a two-phase flow model to simulate oxygenation. Additionally, the influence of various clinician-tunable parameters on oxygenation in the common carotid arteries (CCAs) will be tested, including blood viscosity, cannula position within the insertion artery, heart rate, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), as well as geometric changes such as arterial radius and length. The results aim to elucidate the incidence of cerebral hypoxia in this patient population and the frequent need to adjust cannulation strategies during treatment to address this clinical issue.'

- Title: "Online topological map creation with semantic information for robot-assisted indoor navigation"
  Text: 'Topological maps in robotics are an important tool used to represent the environment. These maps provide an abstract, topological representation of the environment, meaning they do not include details such as graphical representations of objects, but instead, include relationships between various locations or areas in the environment. In this diploma thesis, the online generation of a topological map will be investigated using the information produced by a local robot motion planner, such as the "Dynamic Window Arc-Line" (DWAL) planner [1]. DWAL produces spatiotemporally correlated clusters of motion, which contain both topological and metric information. It has been successfully applied in assisted navigation scenarios for people with motor or cognitive deficits, through the use of robotic Rollator platforms. A further investigation will concern the augmentation of the topological map with semantic information regarding movement directions for people within the space, which will be extracted based on the motion clusters provided by the motion planner algorithm. Experimental evaluation is envisaged to be conducted on the <a href="https://www.i-walk.gr/"  target="_blank">i-Walk intelligent Robotic Rollator platform</a>, which aims at providing mobility and cognitive assistance of elderly and motor-impaired people.'

- Title: "Stress-strain curve of the carotid artery"
  Text: "The stress-strain relationship illustrates the range of strains undergone by a given material under the effect of a range of stresses applied on it. If this relationship is linear, i.e. the material obeys Hooke's law, its slope can be used to estimate the elastic modulus, known as the Young's modulus. This modulus is an index of the stiffness of the material; the higher the modulus, the stiffer the material. The stress-strain relationship has been demonstrated to be feasible in noninvasively assessing regional carotid artery stiffness by way of ultrasound images and tonometry measurements. In this thesis, similar measurements will be used to assess the stress-strain curve and derive the Young's moduli. In particular, the diastolic part of the cardiac cycle will be investigated, and compared to the systolic part; the former having gained less attention than the latter.<br>The work will be carried out in collaboration with the Ultrasound Elasticity Imaging Laboratory of Columbia University."

  Text: "Ultrasound elastography is widely used for characterising tissue stiffness. The primary premises of elastography are that speckle kinematics reproduces underlying tissue kinematics and that tissue motion can be inferred from speckle tracking. Tissue motion can be assessed with a number of methods, including, for example, optical flow (OF) equations. This thesis focuses on the development of a novel motion-based elastography method devoted to B-mode data; traditional ultrasound elastography techniques rely on radiofrequency data. The method will allow computing axial and lateral displacement fields, as well as the 2-D strain tensor. The method will be applied to ultrasound images of the carotid arteries of normal and atherosclerotic subjects."

- Title: "Development of interpretable machine learning models for the risk assessment of multimorbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes"
  Text: "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at high risk of living with and developing multiple co-occurring conditions, namely multimorbidity. Common comorbidities in patients with T2DM include hypertension, lipid disorders, cardiovascular disease, microvascular conditions, chronic kidney disease, arthritis, and depression. T2DM-related multimorbidity impacts significantly clinical care and patient quality of life. Along these lines, the stratification of multimorbid T2DM patients based on the risk of negative health outcomes is critical for the timely identification of targets for treatment initiation and the development of personalized and cost-efficient care plans. This diploma thesis will focus on investigating the use of various machine learning methods towards the development of risk prediction models able to estimate the 5-year risk of the incidence of common morbidities in multimorbid T2DM patients. Emphasis will be placed on the integration of the concept of multimorbidity by exploring and accounting for potential phenotypic associations among multiple morbid conditions, and identifying previously unknown patterns in disease trajectories. Intrepretability techniques will also be applied in order to provide insights into influential risk factors, associated with higher multimorbidity risk scores."

It is characterized abnormal wound healing in response to pulmonary epithelial damage, involving increased activity and possibly exaggerated responses by a spectrum of proinflammatory and profibrogenic factors. The hallmark of IPF is the presence of hyperplastic reparative epithelium overlying distinctive myofibroblastic foci that deposit exuberant Extracellular Matrix (ECM) components, leading to thickening of alveolar septa and the collapse of normal lung architecture. In the context of IPF, the rigidity of the ECM is thought to control the activation of myofibroblasts, the main effector cells in disease pathogenesis.
