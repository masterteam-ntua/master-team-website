- Title: "Artificial intelligence based modeling in the psycho-oncology domain"
  Text: 'Artificial intelligence and statistics based models of the course of several psychological and psychiatric aspects of women with early breast cancer will be developed, based on the experience of <a href="https://www.in-silico-oncology.iccs.ntua.gr/"  target="_blank">In Silico Oncology and In Silico Medicine Group, ICCS, ECE, National Technical University of Athens</a> in the respective domains.

The ultimate goal of the models is to predict the temporal trajectories of crucial psychological and psychiatric aspects (e.g. depression and anxiety) of women, following their early breast cancer treatment, and subsequently to provide suggestions regarding eventual interventions needed for the optimization of quality of life and resilience.'
  
- Title: 'In silico generation of 4D flow MRI data employing computational fluid dynamics simulations in patient-specific abdominal aortic aneurysm models'
  Text: 'There are only limited medical imaging methodologies to non-invasively and accurately assess the blood flow and its properties. The most advanced technique is 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), that enables the calculation of hemodynamic fields across extended vascular regions and can be further processed to produce clinically relevant hemodynamic indices, such as wall shear stresses. The aim of the thesis is to in silico generate 4D flow MRI-like training data starting from computational hemodynamic simulations in patient-specific pathological vascular anatomies, particularly in abdominal aortic aneurysms. Several transformations will be implemented to bridge the gap between the computational fluid dynamics (CFD)- generated blood velocity field and actual imaging data derived from 4D Flow MRI scans. The candidate will collaborate with vascular surgeons and radiologists from the “Attikon” University Hospital who will provide real 4D MRI scans for validation purposes.'
  
- Title: 'Inverse hemodynamic modelling in simplified vascular anatomies using computational fluid dynamics and physics-informed neural networks'
  Text: 'Hemodynamics, the study of blood flow in the circulatory system, is vital for understanding various physiological and pathological processes in the human body. Current non-invasive, high-resolution methods like computational fluid dynamics (CFD) face limitations, particularly in clinical applicability due to high resource demands. This study aims to introduce physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a novel approach for quantifying key hemodynamic parameters, specifically in vascular diseases like arterial stenoses and aneurysms. Training data will be generated using CFD to simulate pulsatile hemodynamics in simplified vascular anatomies, incorporating the injection and transport of contrast agents commonly used in medical imaging tests like computed tomography angiographies. Through PINNs, velocity and pressure fields, along with clinically important hemodynamic indices, can be inversely deduced from the contrast agent transport. The accuracy and generalizability of the PINNs methodology will be rigorously tested against CFD and its applicability for patient-specific 3D hemodynamic modeling.'

- Title: Dissection mechanics of tissue components in human aorta
  Text: 'Aortic dissection frequently occurs and poses a clinical challenge; however, the underlying mechanics remain unclear. The present study will experimentally investigate ex-vivo the dissection properties of the media of human aortas through direct tension tests. The direct tension tests in the radial direction of cylindrical (coin-shaped) medial specimens will yield the radial failure stress. Furthermore, the research will involve histological analysis of specimens obtained at various stages of the process. This study aims to illuminate the mechanisms governing aortic dissection, primarily providing valuable insights into its initiation. This research has the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of aortic dissection, paving the way for more effective treatment strategies in the future. The candidate will collaborate with the Center of Clinical, Experimental Surgery & Translational Research of the Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens (BRFAA).'

- Title: Pumping effect of an Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump. A numerical non-linear model
  Text: "The Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) is a reciprocating pump that operates in series with the heart. Currently, it is one of the most widespread and extensively used methods for temporarily providing mechanical support to the circulatory system, functioning on the principle of counterpulsation. This principle is based on the reduction of aortic pressure during left ventricular systole and an increase in aortic pressure during left ventricular dilation. These primary changes subsequently lead to an increase in coronary flow and oxygen supply to the myocardium, as well as a reduction in the heart's oxygen requirements and a decrease in the systolic workload of the left ventricle. IABP support involves placing a balloon on a catheter in the descending thoracic aorta and coordinating the expansion and contraction of the balloon with the cardiac cycle. In the proposed project, a net flow rate in the aorta will be simulated using an IABP positioned within the aorta vessel, which includes the aortic valve. The cross-sectional area of the aortic valve varies over time as needed. By applying continuity and momentum fluid equations, a first-order differential equation with respect to flow rate is derived, incorporating a nonlinear term responsible for net flow rate generation. This differential equation will be solved numerically using a fourth-order Runge-Kuta numerical scheme."

- Title: 'Flow Rate Augmentation of Valveless Pumping Device via a Time-Dependent Stenosis: a numerical approach'
  Text: 'A valveless pump device consists of a closed hydraulic loop, including a flexible tube and a stiff tube with different elasticities. To achieve the pumping effect, three basic elements are essential: first, the tubes should have different elasticity; second, the excitation should be applied impulsively with relatively rapid acceleration and deceleration phases; and third, the compression point must not be midway along the more flexible tube (asymmetric excitation). Additionally, the installation of a time-dependent tube stenosis close to the pump’s pinching excitation can significantly increase the pumping effect. Flow rate augmentation results from the proper synchronization of the stenosis opening with the tube compression by the pincher. One potential application of this device could be as a blood flow booster in areas of the human body where the blood flow rate is abnormally low due to pathological reasons (ischemic episodes). The fact that this device does not require any external energy source is of paramount importance in this type of application. A device for flow rate augmentation will be simulated in a horizontal valveless closed loop pump using a time-dependent stenosis (convergent-divergent channel). The stenosis, integrated into the flexible tube of the pump, will be simulated as a local constriction attached to a compression spring with adjustable pretension, compressing the tube against a flat plate. Positioned on either side of the pump pincher, the shape of the stenosis changes over time, without any external power source, in response to the fluid pressure and the pretension of the spring. The spring pretension is a free parameter aimed at maximizing the net flow rate for each pinching frequency. Various pinching frequencies and compression ratios will be examined. Key parameters for flow enhancement will be evaluated, including the stenosis location along the loop, its opening, the compression ratio at the pincher area, and the pinching frequency.'
