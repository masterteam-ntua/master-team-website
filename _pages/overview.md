            Program Goals
        </h2>
        <p>
            While funding for biomedical research has increased exponentially in recent years, there has been no corresponding increase 
            in the development of practical solutions to clinical needs. Engineering and Life Sciences graduates need advanced and 
            interdisciplinary training towards this direction. The M.Sc. in Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine at the National 
            Technical University of Athens (NTUA) aims to bridge that gap by preparing students to pioneer the transformation of innovative 
            technologies into commercial devices and services with a significant socioeconomic impact in the field of health.
        </p>
        <p>
            The interdisciplinarity of staff, students, and learning subjects are the key features of the
            M.Sc. in Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine at NTUA.
            The goal of this Master's program is to provide students with:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="mb-3">the scientific, technological, regulatory, and business skills necessary to translate scientific discoveries into
                public and individual health benefits</li>
            <li class="mb-3">advanced research abilities so that they can conduct independent research and contribute to the creation
                of new knowledge in the field of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine</li>
            <li class="mb-3">professional skills that will enable them to serve as healthcare executives with specialized knowledge in
                the scientific areas of this program and meet the growing needs of private and public enterprises,
                agencies, and services in Greece and abroad.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="my-3">
            Program Structure
        </h2>
        <p>
            This program is offered full-time and includes two semesters of coursework and one semester of Master's (M.Sc.) thesis
            research. The maximum study period is two years. To earn the M.Sc. degree, students must: (i) attend and successfully pass 
            7 compulsory and 5 elective courses, corresponding to a total of 60 credits (30 per semester) and (ii) complete and successfully 
            defend their M.Sc. thesis (30 credits). The enrollment in the third semester of studies and the assignment of the M.Sc. thesis can take 
            place at the end of the first year of studies, provided that the student has successfully completed at least half of the M.Sc. program
            courses by that time. The writing language of the M.Sc. thesis is English.
        </p>
        <h2 class="my-3">
            Language of instruction
        </h2>
        <p>
            The courses of the program are taught in English.

            Organizers & Collaborators
        </h2>
        <p>
            The M.Sc. in Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine is organized and offered by the School of Electrical and
            Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens, in collaboration with the School of Mechanical
            Engineering. The Master program is taught by faculty from NTUA and collaborating Universities and research centers.
            Distinguished guest speakers from industry, the clinical sector, and regulatory authorities are also invited to deliver
            lectures and interact with students.
