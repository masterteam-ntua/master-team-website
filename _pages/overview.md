            Program Goals
        </h2>
        <p>
            While funding for biomedical research has increased exponentially in recent years, there has been no corresponding increase
            in the development of practical solutions to clinical needs. Engineering and Life Sciences graduates need advanced and
            interdisciplinary training towards this direction. The M.Sc. in Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine at the National
            Technical University of Athens (NTUA) aims to bridge that gap by preparing students to pioneer the transformation of innovative
            technologies into commercial devices and services with a significant socioeconomic impact in the field of health.
        </p>
        <p>
            The interdisciplinarity of staff, students, and learning subjects are the key features of the
            M.Sc. in Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine at NTUA.
            The goal of this Master's program is to provide students with:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="mb-3">the scientific, technological, regulatory, and business skills necessary to translate scientific discoveries into
                public and individual health benefits</li>
            <li class="mb-3">advanced research abilities so that they can conduct independent research and contribute to the creation
                of new knowledge in the field of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine</li>
            <li class="mb-3">professional skills that will enable them to serve as healthcare executives with specialized knowledge in
                the scientific areas of this program and meet the growing needs of private and public enterprises,
                agencies, and services in Greece and abroad.
            </li>
        </ul>

            Program Structure
        </h2>
        <p>
            The program is offered full-time and includes two semesters of coursework and one semester of Master's (M.Sc.) thesis research. The regular
            duration for completing the M.Sc. program is three (3) academic semesters. The maximum study period is two (2) years. The language of
            instruction is English. Attendance of lectures and laboratory sessions is mandatory. Courses for the academic year 2024-2025 will start in
            October 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            To earn the M.Sc. degree, students must: (i) attend and successfully pass seven (7) compulsory and five (5) elective courses, corresponding
            to a total of 60 credits (30 per semester) and (ii) complete and successfully defend their M.Sc. thesis (30 credits). The enrollment in the
            third semester of studies and the assignment of the M.Sc. thesis can take place at the end of the first year of studies, provided that the
            student has successfully completed at least half of the M.Sc. program courses by that time. The M.Sc. thesis is written in English.
        </p>

            Faculty & Collaborators
        </h2>
        <p>
            The M.Sc. in Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine is taught by faculty from NTUA and collaborating Universities and research
            centers. Distinguished guest speakers from industry, the clinical sector, and regulatory authorities are also invited to deliver lectures and
            interact with students.
