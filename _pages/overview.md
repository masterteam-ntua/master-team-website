            Program Goals
        </h2>
        <p>
            The rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine has created a
            demand for scientists with biomedical and basic engineering science backgrounds who will be pioneers in
            translating innovative technologies into commercial devices and services with a significant socioeconomic
            impact in the field of health.
        </p>
        <p>
            The interdisciplinarity and interculturalism of staff, students, and learning subjects are the key features of the
            Master in Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine at the National Technical University of Athens.
            The goal of this Master's program is to provide students with:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The scientific, technological, regulatory, and business skills necessary to translate scientific discoveries into
                public health benefits</li>
            <li>advanced research abilities so that they can conduct independent research and contribute to the creation
                of new knowledge in the field of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine</li>
            <li>professional skills that will enable them to serve as healthcare executives with specialized knowledge in
                the scientific areas of this program and meet the growing needs of private and public enterprises,
                agencies, and services in Greece and abroad
            </li>
