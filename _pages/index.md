            Translational Engineering is the process of translating engineering research findings
            and discoveries into innovations and functional products. Applications of Translational
            Engineering in Health and Medicine focus on the developmentof devices and services to
            improve the public and individual health.

            The M.Sc. in Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine, organized by the National
            Technical University of Athens (NTUA), is designed to prepare students to pioneer the
            transformation of innovative technologies into commercial devices and services with a
            significant socioeconomic impact in the field of Health. The program builds on NTUA's
            decades of foundational work in biomedical engineering and science and focuses on cultivating
            deep knowledge and catalyzing interdisciplinary efforts to address urgent healthcare challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Students study and work on cutting-edge topics in biomedical data science and artificial
            intelligence, neuroengineering, multiscale modeling, digital health, intelligent reality, healthcare
            robotics, and biomedical microelectromechanical systems (BioMEMs) among others. The curriculum focuses
            on instilling entrepreneurial and leadership skills in students as well as exposing them to all of the
            steps involved in translating research discoveries into innovative medical products and services.
            The program fosters a multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach through student internships in
            research labs, clinical departments, and industry.
