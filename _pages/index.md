                <p>
                    Translational Engineering is the process of translating engineering research findings
                    and discoveries into innovations and functional products. Applications of Translational
                    Engineering in Health and Medicine focus on the developmentof devices and services to
                    improve the public and individual health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The M.Sc. in Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine, organized by the <a href="https://www.ece.ntua.gr">School of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> of the <a href="https://www.ntua.gr">National Technical University of Athens</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.mech.ntua.gr">School of Mechanical Engineering</a>, is designed to prepare students to pioneer the transformation of innovative technologies into commercial devices and services with a significant socioeconomic impact in the field of Health. The program builds on NTUA's decades of foundational work in biomedical engineering and science and focuses on cultivating deep knowledge and catalyzing interdisciplinary efforts to address urgent healthcare challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students study and work on cutting-edge topics in biomedical data science and artificial
                    intelligence, neuroengineering, multiscale modeling, digital health, intelligent reality, healthcare
                    robotics, and biomedical microelectromechanical systems (BioMEMs) among others. The curriculum focuses
                    on instilling entrepreneurial and leadership skills in students as well as exposing them to all of the
                    steps involved in translating research discoveries into innovative medical products and services.
                    The program fosters a multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach through student internships in
                    research labs, clinical departments, and industry.
