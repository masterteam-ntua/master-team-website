        <p>
            An introductory outline of the basic anatomy and physiology of the human body for engineers. The objective of this
            course is to present the various levels of structural organization of the body, from chemical through cellular and
            tissue organization to organ, system, and whole body structure and function. The role of physical principles and
            phenomena as they are known to exist and apply to living systems will be highlighted in engineering terms. The
            aim is to (i) develop a quantitative intuition of biological systems; (ii) understand how principles in engineering can
            be used to study biological processes; and (iii) understand the relationships between structure and function at
            different size and time scales. Guest lectures will include engineers and medical scientists to discuss the
            relationship between recent advances in biomedical engineering and the underlying anatomy and physiology.

            This is the first part of a two-semester course. Multidisciplinary teams of students identify real-world medical needs, evaluate
            their potential health and commercial impact, invent new health technology products to address those needs, and plan their
            full implementation into patient care. In this first course, the students either bring their own ideas or identify real-world needs
            by visiting clinical settings and interviewing end-users. Via a well-structured process that includes stakeholder analysis and
            market analysis, the students prioritize the ideas and select the ones that will be implemented in the subsequent semester in
            the course “Biodesign Innovation Process”.

            This course targets to: (1) introduce fundamental design and microfabrication concepts of BioMEMS (including microfluidics
            and lab-on-chip systems) and (2) expose students to the relevant biomedical and biological applications of BioMEMS. The
            course is divided into three main sections: (i) Microfabrication and Materials of BioMEMS, (ii) Design of BioMEMS sensors and
            actuators, and (iii) BioMEMS applications.

        <p>
            This course involves a deep dive into recent advances in AI in healthcare, focusing in particular on deep learning approaches
            for medicine and healthcare problems. The course will start from foundations of neural networks and will then cover cutting-edge deep learning models in the context of a variety of healthcare data including image, text, multimodal and time-series
            data. Metrics unique to healthcare, as well as best practices for designing, building, and evaluating AI-based approaches in
            healthcare will be presented. Advanced topics on open challenges of integrating AI in healthcare, including interpretability,
            robustness, privacy and fairness will also be covered. The course aims to provide students from diverse backgrounds with both
            conceptual understanding and practical grounding of cutting-edge research on AI in healthcare.

            The course intends to explore human robot interaction (HRI) in healthcare and cover the entire continuum of care from
            hospital to home, by tackling robotic challenges in surgery, assistance, and rehabilitation — three domains where robots are
            having the biggest impact. The course will also explore how artificial intelligence is used in surgical procedures, to improve
            precision diagnostics, in exoskeleton technology, and for patient care. Topics to be covered include: medical imaging-guided
            surgery; minimally-invasive surgery through miniaturization, novel actuation and sensing; robotic surgery at tissue and cell
            levels; autonomous robotic systems to assist with daily living activities; multi-modal robot interfaces; robotics-based
            rehabilitation technologies; upper limb rehabilitation robots; wearable exoskeletons and sensors; implanted neural interfaces.

            In this course, students are introduced to various aspects of medical device entrepreneurship. The students acquire a very
            diverse set of soft skills and are exposed to all steps required to bring a research discovery to a medical product or service.
            Lectures will be centered around case studies and often given by guest speakers from start-ups, regulatory experts, patent
            attorneys, clinical trial specialists, and investment firms to give students a sense of the process and challenges in developing
            their own business idea. Students will have the opportunity to discuss case studies based on other people’s experience of
            bringing medical devices to market and the specific challenges associated with the development of new products in the
            medical sector.
