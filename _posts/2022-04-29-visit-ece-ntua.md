As the local public health situation has improved, the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens (ECE-NTUA) is once again allowing Senior high school (Lykeion) group visits.

The ECE-NTUA Communication Office conducts informative sessions (reservations are requested), tailored to the requirements of each school and the educational level of the visiting students, in accordance with public health directives. A typical tour in the premises of the ECE-NTUA School provides a history of the Institution, a brief presentation of the undergraduate program of the School, short visits to research laboratories, meeting of members of research teams (professors, senior researchers and Ph.D. students) and learning about their activities.

Please make your request at least one month in advance (contact email: publicity@ece.ntua.gr).
