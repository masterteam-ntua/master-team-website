NTUA TEAM students are invited to apply for an internship opportunity at the University of Cambridge, which will be integrated into their MSc thesis.

The selected student will work on a project focused on developing and optimizing the analysis pipeline for a novel neuroimaging technique called functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This technique measures cortical oxygenation changes. The project will use data collected at the University of Cambridge as part of the CHARISMA study, a sub-study of the larger <a href ="https://preventdementia.co.uk">PREVENT-Dementia project</a>. The CHARISMA dataset will include fNIRS data from approximately 90 participants, along with neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical data obtained during their study visits.

The selected student will have the opportunity to spend 1 to 2 months between October 2025 and December 2025 at the University of Cambridge and will be part of the Old Age Psychiatry research group (Cambridge supervisor: Dr. Marialena Dounavi) during their stay. The MSc thesis will be co-supervised by Prof. Konstantina Nikita from NTUA. A fixed allowance is available to cover accommodation and travel expenses to and from Cambridge.

Applicants must have excellent programming skills in Matlab and/or Python.

Interested candidates are invited to send their application to masterteam-info@ece.ntua.gr by March 18. The application should include a CV and a one-page cover letter explaining their interest in this opportunity and how they envision this project contributing to their future career plans.

For more details about the project, please contact Dr. Marialena Dounavi (med57@cam.ac.uk).
