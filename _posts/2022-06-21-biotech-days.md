The second part of Biotech Days was successfully completed with two inspiring talks given by the NTUA alumni, Giannis Stoitsis and Despoina Moschou, 
on the 25th of May and the 1st of June. The speakers shared their journey in the field of biomedical engineering and engaged in a lively discussion 
with the attending students about the transformation of an idea into an AI-powered service, and about ground-breaking innovative biomedical technologies 
like Lab-on-Chip.
