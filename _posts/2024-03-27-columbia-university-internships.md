As the review process of the applications for an internship at Columbia University (CU) has been concluded, we are happy to announce that six (6) candidates have been shortlisted, and will be notified by email. Evaluation relied on submitted CVs and statements of purpose as well as on student performance at Master-TEAM courses during the first semester. Shortlisted candidates will be interviewed by NTUA and CU faculty (details will follow), and the final list of students will be able to receive a travel grant for their internships in Columbia University.
