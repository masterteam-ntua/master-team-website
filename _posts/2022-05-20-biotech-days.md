The first part of Biotech Days was successfully completed on the 19th of May. NTUA alumni, George Varsos, Omiros Exarhos, and Asimina Glinou, gave inspiring talks in a series of events that took place every Thursday afternoon in May. The speakers shared their journey in the field of biomedical engineering and engaged in a lively discussion with the attending students about the founding process and the growth potential of a biotech start-up, along with issues related to innovation and intellectual property.
