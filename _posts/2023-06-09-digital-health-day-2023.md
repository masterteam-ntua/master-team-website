We are thrilled to announce the successful completion of the NTUA Digital Health Day 2023, an event showcasing the remarkable achievements of two teams of graduate students, Cordia and Nanay, from the courses "Biodesign Fundamentals" and "Biodesign Innovation Process" in the field of digital health innovation. The event took place on June 8th at the central library of National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) and was filled with excitement, creativity, and ideas aiming to provide meaningful and impactful solutions.

The two teams pitched their projects, a social platform aiming to create supportive communities among patients (Cordia) and a breastfeeding app/device which monitors breast milk consumption (Nanay), to a committee of experts. The committee consisted of Elomida Visviki (Entrepreneur and Angel Investor), Angelos Angelou (Investor and cofounder International Accelerator), Marina Kalogerakou (Associate @ Genesis Ventures), Konstantinos Karvounakis (Principal @ Metavallon). Their insights and guidance offered valuable feedback to the student teams, helping them refine their projects and ideas.

We extend our heartfelt congratulations to both teams and commend them for their hard work, determination, and passion. We would also like to express our gratitude to our distinguished members of the committee who supported and contributed to the success of NTUA Digital Health Day 2023. Their active participation enriched the event, inspiring both teams to push the boundaries beyond their courses.
