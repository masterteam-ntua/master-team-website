The first part of Biotech Days was successfully completed on the 19th of May. NTUA alumni, George Varsos, Omiros Exarhos, and Asimina Glinou, gave inspiring talks in a series of events that took place every Thursday afternoon in May. The speakers shared their journey in the field of biomedical engineering and engaged in a lively discussion with the attending students about the founding process and the growth potential of a biotech start-up, along with issues related to innovation and intellectual property.

Biosys lab (Ass. Prof. L. Alexopoulos) and Biosim lab (Prof. K. Nikita) of NTUA are organizing Biotech days, a series of lectures by NTUA alumni who are pursuing successful careers in biomedical engineering. The lectures address issues related to entrepreneurship, management, innovation, and patents. These events are organised in collaboration with the IEEE Greece section, IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology chapter, and IEEE Computational Intelligence chapter.
