Two student teams from the MSc Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine have been accepted into "Lab to Market: Bridging Innovation and Entrepreneurship", an innovative training program in startup entrepreneurship and innovation.
The program is jointly organized by the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Columbia University, the Athens Columbia Global Center, and Endeavor Greece, with the generous support of the Blavatnik Family Foundation.

As part of the program, the teams participated in the Lab to Market Bootcamp, which took place on 14–16 January 2026. During the bootcamp, participants engaged in intensive workshops and mentoring sessions focused on innovation development, entrepreneurship fundamentals, and the translation of academic research into real-world applications.

The Lab to Market program is designed to support early-stage teams in bridging the gap between research and market impact, providing structured training, expert guidance, and access to an international innovation network.

We congratulate the participating teams on their selection and look forward to following their progress throughout the program.
