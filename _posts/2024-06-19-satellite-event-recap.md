We are proud to share the success of the satellite event held in conjunction with the 21st IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2024). The event brought together a diverse group of students, faculty members, and industry leaders to explore the exciting field education, research, innovation.

The program featured esteemed speakers like Dr. Elisa E. Konofagou and Dr. Andrew F. Laine from Columbia University, who shared their cutting-edge expertise on deep learning applications in medical imaging and airway tree subtyping for COPD risk assessment. Dr. Konstantina Nikita (NTUA) delivered a thought-provoking address outlining the TEAM program's vision towards the education of future engineers with a holistic understanding of both engineering principles and medical needs. Dr. Ipatia Doussis-Anagnostopoulou (University of Athens) and Dr. Spyretta Golemati (University of Athens) further enriched the event by providing essential grounding in life sciences and engineering for biomedicine, respectively. These insightful talks were complemented by presentations from current TEAM students, offering a glimpse into their ongoing research. Katerina Afentouli and Konstantinos Tziavaras shared their experiences at Columbia University, while Thodoris Spiliotis showcased the potential of engineering solutions in mental health.

The satellite event culminated in a session focused on fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. Dr. Leonidas Alexopoulos (NTUA) and Vassilis Papakonstantinou (Blue Dome Capital) offered valuable guidance for translating scientific discoveries into real-world healthcare solutions.

This successful event served as a valuable platform for knowledge exchange and inspiration. It solidified the TEAM program's commitment to nurturing the next generation of translational engineers â€“ a group poised to bridge the gap between engineering advancements and improved healthcare.
