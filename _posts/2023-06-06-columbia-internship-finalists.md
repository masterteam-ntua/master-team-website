We are pleased to announce that two (2) Master TEAM students were finally selected for an internship at Columbia University (CU), and will be notified by email. 
Three (3) candidates remain in the reserve list. 

Final selection among shortlisted candidates relied on interviews by NTUA and CU faculty, as well as availability of funds, housing, and host laboratory positions. 
The duration of each internship is one month: from 17 July to 16 August.

Internships are supported by a scholarship, offered by the Bodossakis Foundation and Columbia University. Scholarships cover travel and accommodation at Columbia University Guest Housing.
