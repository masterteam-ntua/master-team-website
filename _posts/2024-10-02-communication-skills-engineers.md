Starting from the fall semester of the academic year 2024-2025, a Joint Elective Course with the title “Communication Skills for Engineers” has been introduced into the curriculum of the 11 internationalized MSc Programs of NTUA. It is scheduled for 2 teaching hours weekly and provides 3 ECTS credits, which cannot be included in the Degree Grade, but will be included in the Diploma Supplement.
The declaration of interest for enrollment will be submitted via the following online application form (google form), which will be active only for a specific time limit, simultaneously for all 11 internationalized MSc Programs. Τhe form cannot accept responses beyond the specific time limit.

The <a href="https://forms.gle/XNaV9tYBRoYqyJcW8">online form</a> will accept applications starting on Thursday October 3rd, 2024, at 10 am until Friday October 4th, 2024, at 2 pm. The first three (3) students who will apply per MSc Program will have the right to enrol at the Secretariat of the said MSc Program, with the possibility of appointing a runner-up list.

Course description

This course is designed to enhance students’ knowledge of written and oral communication skills in an engineering context. The course will help students to properly structure and write their course assignments and dissertation. In particular, students will learn how to manage and evaluate relevant and reliable sources, cite sources appropriately in their written material, write abstracts and reports concisely and meaningfully, write critical literature reviews and critically analyse key issues in engineering topics both in a written and an oral format. This course is interdisciplinary and is mainly based on the use of case studies addressing a number of topical engineering issues (e.g. sustainability, engineering failure analysis, engineering ethics, energy transition, etc.). By engaging with these case studies, students will not only refine their communication skills, but also deepen their understanding of specialised engineering terminology while gaining valuable insights into the principal challenges faced today.
