NTUA TEAM students are invited to apply for an internship opportunity at the University of Cambridge, which will be integrated into their MSc thesis. Students who have already applied do not have to resubmit their application. 

Candidates will have to send their CV and a one page cover letter in English to masterteam-info@ece.ntua.gr by May 28, describing why they are interested in this opportunity and how they envision this project will help with their future career plans. 

The selected candidate will work on an exciting project focused on analysis of 3T MRI neurovascular data. The data analysis project will be focused on extraction of vascular neuroimaging biomarkers such as small vessel disease measures or measures extracted from a cerebral angiogram. The data which will be used in the project are actively being collected as part of a study in the University of Cambridge called CHARISMA, which is a sub-study of the larger project called PREVENT-Dementia (https://preventdementia.co.uk). The final dataset for CHARISMA will comprise around 100 participants with MRI scans who have further neuroimaging, cognitive and clinical data collected as part of their study visit. 

The appointed person will have the opportunity to spend 1-2 months in Cambridge. A fixed allowance is available to cover accommodation and traveling to and from Cambridge. The appointed person will be part of the Old Age Psychiatry research group (Cambridge supervisor: Marialena Dounavi) during their stay. The thesis will be completed jointly with Prof. Konstantina Nikitaâ€™s group in NTUA.

People who will apply for this opportunity must have some understanding of MRI and /or background in neuroscience and ideally some programming skills. Interested candidates who require more details about the project are encouraged to contact Dr. Marialena Dounavi (med57@cam.ac.uk).
