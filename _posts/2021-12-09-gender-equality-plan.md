The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens has developed a two-year Gender Equality Plan (covering the academic years 2021-2022, 2022-2023).

The plan includes a series of internal actions aimed at addressing a number of gender-related issues, such as the collection of gendered data, work-life balance, and awareness raising. In addition, it includes a number of collaborative actions involving external stakeholders (organisations and individuals).

Briefly, the internal actions of the plan are:

The setting of internal targets on the representation of women
Establishment of formal procedures to handle incidents of bias and sexist behaviour in the working environment
Development of a framework for working conditions of researchers in the ECE-NTUA School
Establishment of a Gender Equality Office
Collection of gender disaggregated data
Supporting the application of the “Guide of using non-sexist language in administrative documents”
Set targets and indicators for the inclusion of the gender dimension in research output
Integration of gender-related topics in selected courses and lectures
Seminar on gender topics for students
Including a gender dimension in the new Alumni Network
Establishment of a formal mechanism dealing with cases of sexual harassment and gender violence
Collection of data on Intersectionality
Additionally, the collaborative actions include:

Engagement of Role models and dissemination activities
Creation of a “Women in STEM” network
ECE-NTUA Open Days
Information Days and Training Workshops on gender issues in STEM
Women in Innovation (WIN) event
The School was supported during the development of the plan by the CALIPER - Gender Equality in STEM Research project (Horizon 2020).

This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 873134.
