The MSc in Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA TEAM) successfully held its Welcome Event for New Students on Monday, October 6, 2025, at the Conference Room of the New ECE Building, Zografos Campus.

The event commenced with a Welcome Address by Prof. Konstantina Nikita, Program Director, who greeted the incoming class of 2025-2026 and outlined the program’s vision, objectives, and interdisciplinary character at the intersection of engineering and medicine.

This was followed by a Faculty Panel, featuring presentations and discussions by distinguished members of academia and industry who provided valuable insights into the program’s scientific scope, its translational approach, and the strong collaboration between research, healthcare, and entrepreneurship.

A Student Panel followed, featuring current students and alumni who shared their experiences from internship opportunities at leading institutions, including Columbia University and the University of Cambridge. The long-standing collaboration with Columbia University, through which seven NTUA students have conducted cutting-edge biomedical research in world-class laboratories, has been a defining pillar of the program since its launch. The newly established partnership with the University of Cambridge further expands these international opportunities, marking an exciting step in the program’s evolution. The students’ insights into research, innovation, and professional development offered valuable guidance and inspiration for the incoming class, underscoring the program’s international scope and strong academic network.

The event concluded with a Networking Session, providing an excellent opportunity for new students to interact informally with faculty, alumni, and peers, fostering a sense of community and collaboration.

The NTUA TEAM faculty and staff warmly welcome the new students and wish them a productive, inspiring, and successful academic year 2025–2026.
