Nearing the completion of the very first year of the M.Sc. in Translational Engineering in Health & Medicine (TEAM), NTUA Digital Health Day 2023 gives the opportunity to students who have followed the course series on Biodesign to pitch their projects to a panel of experts who will provide valuable feedback.
All students are invited to the event, which will take place on June 8, at 3 pm, in the multimedia amphitheatre situated in the central library building, Zografou Campus.
