Dear Students,

You have recently received links from the Quality Assurance Unit (QAU) of the NTUA asking you to provide your feedback by completing the online evaluation questionnaire for the courses of the MSc Program "Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine". 

You are kindly requested to participate in this very important process that will help us improve the educational content and methods of the Program.

We very much value your feedback and look forward to your active participation.
